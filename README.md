# FOUR-TASK
"10000 Hours" Theory?  Malcolm T.Gladwell, author of 《Outliers》,  mentions the 10,000-hour rule. He states that it's "an extraordinarily consistent answer in an incredible number of fields ... you need to have practiced, to have apprenticed, for 10,000 hours before you get good.  A Question?  If a person would like to be an expert in one field, based on that theory, he needs to work for 10000 hours. That means he would be the expert after almost 10 years with a frequency of 8 hours a day and 5 workdays a week.
